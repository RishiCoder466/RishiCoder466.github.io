      <h2>Concepts Covered</h2>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Creating New SwiftUI Views</h3>
        <p>Creating new views in SwiftUI involves defining a new struct that conforms to the View protocol, allowing you to build reusable UI components.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Modifying SwiftUI Views</h3>
        <p>SwiftUI views can be modified using various modifiers, which change their appearance or behavior, such as changing colors, adding padding, or setting alignment.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>SwiftUI Views</h3>
        <p>SwiftUI offers a variety of built-in views that help you build user interfaces quickly. These include Text, Image, Button, and more, each with unique properties.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Composability</h3>
        <p>Composability in SwiftUI allows you to combine multiple views to create complex interfaces, making your code more modular and maintainable.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Modifying State</h3>
        <p>Managing state in SwiftUI is crucial for building interactive apps. You can use @State and other property wrappers to track changes in your app's data.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Using a Conditional Modifier</h3>
        <p>Conditional modifiers allow you to alter view attributes based on certain conditions, helping you create dynamic interfaces that respond to user interactions.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>SwiftUI Built-in Views</h3>
        <p>SwiftUI includes built-in views like List and Form that simplify the process of creating standard interface elements while ensuring a consistent look and feel.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Navigating in SwiftUI</h3>
        <p>Navigation in SwiftUI is achieved using NavigationView and NavigationLink, enabling smooth transitions between different views within your app.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Sharing Data Between Views</h3>
        <p>Data can be shared between views using binding or state management techniques, allowing for consistent data representation across the app's interface.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Creating a New View to Share Data</h3>
        <p>Creating a new view that can receive data from a parent view enhances modularity and makes it easier to manage complex user interfaces.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Adding and Deleting Creatures</h3>
        <p>This concept involves implementing functionality to add new items to a list and remove them, providing a dynamic way to manage collections within your app.</p>
      </div>
      
      <div class="concept">
        <h3>Adding a CreatureDetail View</h3>
        <p>Creating a detailed view for each creature allows users to view more information about selected items, improving the overall user experience.</p>
